# ClasMate

ClassMate is a web application for booking and managing fitness and wellness classes like yoga, gym, and dance. It allows users to book classes within capacity limits and manage waiting lists for full classes. Users can cancel bookings up to 30 minutes before the class starts, with slots reassigned from the waiting list. The application features a responsive UI with filters and pagination for class management. It includes client-side session handling, test-driven development for reliability, and client-side caching for performance. The project should be well-structured, clean, and professional, with a focus on user-friendly design and efficient API integration.
